    "Recall and ROC-AUC score were chosen. Recall was chosen because of the high importance to predict whether west nile virus is present. West nile virus has potential to cause harm to human and in some cases, it causes death and hence, missing this label should be avoided. Recall gives the percentage of how well our model can predict the west nile virus label. The higher the recall, the better the model performance. ROC-AUC which stands for Area Under Curve Receiver Operator Characteristic is area under the probability curve where the curve is plotted with True Positive Rate against the False Positive Rate. It measures how well our model is able to distinguish between the labels. ROC-AUC score was chosen as the secondary metric to ensure that the other label is not too poorly predicted and gives us the flexibility to adjust the probability boundary between the two labels. The higher the recall and ROC-AUC score and closer to 1, the better the model performance."
